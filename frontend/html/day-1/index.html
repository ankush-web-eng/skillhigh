<strong>
  The first website at CERN – and in the world – was dedicated to the World Wide
  Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer. In 2013,
  CERN launched a project to restore this first ever website: info.cern.ch. On
  30 April 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain.
